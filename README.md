Seismic noise tomography
========================
This project is dedicated to provide a Python framework for seismic noise tomography, 
based on [ObsPy](https://github.com/obspy/obspy/wiki) and numerical Python packages 
such as [numpy](http://www.numpy.org/) and [scipy](http://www.scipy.org/).

Requirements
------------
The code is developped and tested on Ubuntu (but should run on other platforms as well)
with Python 2.7.

slowly being updated for python 3.7 compatibility - HFM 03.6.2020

In addition to [Python 2.7](https://www.python.org/download/releases/2.7/), you need
to install the following packages:  ** make that 3.7, actually

- [numpy](http://www.numpy.org/) >= 1.8.2
- [scipy](http://www.scipy.org/) >= 0.13.3
- [matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org/) >= 1.3.1  ** now >2? or 3? HFM 03.27.2020
- [ObsPy](https://github.com/obspy/obspy/wiki) >= 0.9.2  ** later version needed
- [pyshp](https://github.com/GeospatialPython/pyshp)
- [pyproj](https://code.google.com/p/pyproj/) >= 1.8.9
- [pyPdf](http://pybrary.net/pyPdf/)  ** now PyPDF2 - HFM 03.26.2020

It is recommended to install these packages with `pip install ...` or with your
favourite package manager, e.g., `apt-get install ...`.  ** personally, I'd recommend anaconda

Optionally, you may want to install the 
[Computer Programs in Seismology](http://www.eas.slu.edu/eqc/eqccps.html)
to be able to invert your dispersion maps for a 1-D shear velocity model,
as these programs take care of the forward modelling.

How to start
------------
You should start reading the example configuration file, `tomo_Brazil.cnf`, which
contains global parameters and detailed instructions. You should then create 
your own configuration file (any name with cnf extension, \*.cnf) with your
own parameters, and place it in the same folder as the scripts. It is not advised
to simply modify `tomo_Brazil.cnf`, as any update may revert your changes.

You may then use the scripts in the following order:

- `crosscorrelation.py` takes seismic waveforms as input in order to calculate 
and export cross-correlations between pairs of stations,

- `dispersion_curves.py` takes cross-correlations as input and applies
a frequency-time analysis (FTAN) in order to extract and export group velocity
dispersion curves,

- `tomo_inversion_testparams.py` takes dispersion curves as input and applies
 a tomographic inversion to produce dispersion maps; the inversion parameters
 are systematically varied within user-defined ranges,

- `tomo_inversion_2pass.py` takes dispersion curves as input and applies
 a two-pass tomographic inversion to produce dispersion maps: an overdamped
 inversion is performed in the first pass in order to detect and reject outliers
 from the second pass.
 
- `1d_models.py` takes dispersion maps as input and invert them for a 1-D
  shear velocity model at selected locations, using a Markov chain Monte Carlo
  method to sample to posterior distribution of the model's parameters.
 
The scripts rely on the Python package `pysismo`, which must thus be located
in a place included in your PATH (or PYTHONPATH) environment variable. The easiest
choice is of course to place it in the same folder as the scripts.

How to update
-------------
The code is still experimental so you should regularly check for (and pull) 
updates. These will be backward-compatible, **except if new parameters appear 
in the configuration file**.

**In other words, after any update, you should check whether new parameters were added
to the example configuration file (`tomo_Brazil.cnf`) and insert them accordingly
to your own configuration file.**

The cross-correlation procedure of ambient noise between pairs of stations follows
the steps advocated by Bensen et al. (2007). 
The measurement of dispersion curves is based on the frequency-time
analysis (FTAN) with phase-matched filtering described in Levshin and Ritzwoller (2001) 
and Bensen et al. (2007).
The tomographic inversion implements the linear inversion procedure 
with norm penalization and spatial smoothing of Barmin et al. (2001).
The Markov chain Monte Carlo method is described by Mosegaard and Tarantola (1995), 
and the forward modelling is taken care of by the Computer Programs in Seimology 
(Herrmann, 2013).
